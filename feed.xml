The rules are simple enough. 12 cards are dealt, all of which have images with four properties: color, number, shape, and texture. The challenge is to find sets of three cards such that, for each property, either all cards are the same or all cards are different. For example, in the a... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Data Mining my Favorite Game</title><link href="https://swiddis.github.io/posts/Joseki-Scraping/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Data Mining my Favorite Game" /><published>2022-02-17T20:31:00-07:00</published> <updated>2022-02-17T20:36:47-07:00</updated> <id>https://swiddis.github.io/posts/Joseki-Scraping/</id> <content src="https://swiddis.github.io/posts/Joseki-Scraping/" /> <author> <name>Simeon Widdis</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <category term="Explorations" /> <summary> At this point it’s probably no secret that I love Python. Slightly better-kept is the fact that I love this game called Go. It saw a bit of a surge in popularity in the west after DeepMind’s AlphaGo beat one of the top players of the time, myself being one of many to hop on the bandwagon of new players. It’s somewhat rare for the two hobbies of programming and Go to intertwine; however, you’ve... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Breaking Hashes, Part I.

It’s hard to point to a specific reason why, but there’s something interesting about the fact that you can compute a deterministic value for a given input, and that you can’t easily find what the original input was. It’s not hard to imagine how something like this could exist, but I’ve long been interested in the specifics. What specifically makes a ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Descending Through Arrays and Problem Solving</title><link href="https://swiddis.github.io/posts/Descending-Arrays/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Descending Through Arrays and Problem Solving" /><published>2021-11-15T12:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2021-11-15T18:40:11-07:00</updated> <id>https://swiddis.github.io/posts/Descending-Arrays/</id> <content src="https://swiddis.github.io/posts/Descending-Arrays/" /> <author> <name>Simeon Widdis</name> </author> <category term="Blogging" /> <category term="Problems" /> <summary> A Mystery is Afoot Like many of the best stories in mathematics, our story today begins with playful pondering. We could be thinking of any number of things: a video game, a chore, opening presents for the upcoming Christmas, opening presents in a certain order, visiting indices of an array… Well, there’s an interesting thought. What if our Christmas presents contained a pointer to the next p... </summary> </entry> </feed>
