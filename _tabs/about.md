I'm a software engineer, math geek, and speedcuber, who spends my free-time solving little problems I encounter or make up. A lot of times I enjoy sharing my solutions to those problems with my friends, because I think that some of the things I do are interesting. At some point, it struck me that I could make a blog about exactly this, and share my anecdotes with the world.

My problems are all naturally encountered, and exceptional, instructive solutions are rare. As such, expect this blog to have inconsistent uploads, with the hopes of them being high-quality when they arrive.

### More Information

I've been programming for close to a decade now, and relatively recently took the plunge to pursue a career in computer science. I've always liked problem solving, but only fell in love with mathematics after reading [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) in the Summer of 2017. Since then, I've encountered a lot of problems of varying complexity, and occasionally I've come up with useful ideas or problem-solving tactics that help me regularly in my career and my recreational mathematics. Since I also have a passion for teaching, I decided to start this blog, in hopes of sharing my experiences with others.

A special thanks to Paul Lockhart, 3blue1brown, Calliope Mori, Matt Parker, my friends & family, Ann, and a few others, for collectively motivating me to start this.
